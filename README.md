This dataset contains information about air conditioners, covering various attributes that influence their performance, efficiency, and pricing. The Brand column specifies the manufacturer, such as Brand A, Brand B, and Brand C, which can impact quality, reliability, and pricing. Capacity (BTUs) measures the cooling power of each unit. EER/SEER (Energy Efficiency Ratio/Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) represents the efficiency of the air conditioner, where higher values mean lower energy consumption and cost savings. The Type column categorizes air conditioners into different models such as Portable, Window, and Split, which vary in installation requirements and cooling efficiency. The Features column lists special functionalities like WiFi connectivity, Inverter Technology, and noise reduction, enhancing user convenience and energy efficiency. Location indicates where the air conditioner is used, such as India, USA, or Europe, reflecting market trends and regional preferences. The Age (years) column represents how old the unit is, affecting its efficiency, warranty status, and potential maintenance needs. Finally, Price shows the cost of each air conditioner in US dollars, influenced by brand, capacity, energy efficiency, features, and market demand. This dataset provides valuable insights for comparing air conditioners based on energy efficiency, technology, and affordability across different regions.

Conclusion: This dataset represents a supervised learning problem, where price is the dependent or target variable, as it is influenced by other attributes such as brand, capacity, energy efficiency, type, features, location, and age. Since the target variable is numerical and can take a wide range of continuous values, this dataset falls under regression analysis.
